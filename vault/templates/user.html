# Would like to eventually have each page be restricted to the corresponding user as well as admin. The 'profile' could show info like earnings over different periods - by week, month, YTD (maybe even average for all Fridays or Saturdays?). Other possibilities include average shift time, ytd wage hour (let users add in their hourly to compute?) user selected avatars?
